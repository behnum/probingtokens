Greetings!

My name is Behnam Baharmand and I'm a second year student studying MA in English Linguistics at Linnaeus University. I'm passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and exploring its application to discourse analysis, particularly in the political realm. I am also very interested in the cognitive processes of Second Language Acquisition.

When I'm not studying, I like to spend my time coding, doing photography, and exploring new places.

I'm always open to learning more about linguistics, data mining and NLP, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate on a project!

Thanks for reading!
